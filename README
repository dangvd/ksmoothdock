KSmoothDock is a cool desktop panel with parabolic zooming effect for KDE Plasma 5. While visually it is inspired by Mac OS X's Dock, it aims to follow the traditional Linux model of desktop panel with application menu, launchers, pager, taskbar and system tray. Currently KSmoothDock only supports launchers and pager, and is meant to use in conjunction with a Plasma 5 panel that provides application menu, taskbar and system tray.

KSmoothDock is written in C++ and depends on Qt 5 and KDE Frameworks 5.
